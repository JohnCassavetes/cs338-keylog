Prompt: okay i want find how to make .bat file open txt and execute python file in insiders folders, but i don't want the command prompt window to open.

To open a `.txt` file and run a Python script without a visible Command Prompt window, you can use a Windows shortcut with a `.bat` or `.vbs` (VBScript) file. Hereâ€™s how to achieve this:

### Method 1: Use a `.vbs` (VBScript) File

1. **Create a `.bat` File**:
   - This file should include the commands to open the `.txt` file and run the Python script.
   - Example `run_script.bat`:

     ```bat
     @echo off
     start "" "C:\path\to\your\file.txt"
     start /min python "C:\path\to\Insiders\your_script.py"
     ```

   Replace `"C:\path\to\your\file.txt"` and `"C:\path\to\Insiders\your_script.py"` with the actual paths.

2. **Create a `.vbs` File** to Run the `.bat` File Silently:
   - Open Notepad and paste the following VBScript code:

     ```vbs
     Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
     WshShell.Run chr(34) & "C:\path\to\run_script.bat" & chr(34), 0
     Set WshShell = Nothing
     ```

   - Save this as `run_silently.vbs`.
   - Replace `"C:\path\to\run_script.bat"` with the actual path to your `.bat` file.

3. **Run the `.vbs` File**:
   - Double-click on `run_silently.vbs` to execute it.
   - This will open the `.txt` file and run the Python script without showing any Command Prompt window.

### Method 2: Use a Shortcut to Run Python in the Background

If you only need to run the Python script without showing Command Prompt (and do not need the `.bat` file), you can directly create a shortcut:

1. **Create a Shortcut**:
   - Right-click on the desktop or folder and select **New > Shortcut**.
   - For the location, enter:

     ```cmd
     pythonw.exe "C:\path\to\Insiders\your_script.py"
     ```

   - `pythonw.exe` is a version of Python that runs without a console window.
   - Complete the shortcut setup, then double-click it to run the Python script invisibly.

2. **Open the `.txt` File Separately**:
   - If needed, double-click the `.txt` file directly to open it in the default editor.

These methods allow you to open the `.txt` file and run a Python script without the Command Prompt window appearing.
